## Ralph Loop Autonomous Development
**Iteration**: 12
**Status**: active
**Mode**: 24/7 autonomous AI development

### Current Mission
Autonomous AI development cycle: pick tasks from PLANS.md/TODO.md, implement with co-author commits, push after each iteration, track costs by model.

### Task Sources
- PLANS.md (high/medium/low priority items)
- TODO.md (active task tracking)
- MCP tool suggestions
- Code quality issues (lint/type errors)
- Documentation gaps

### Workflow
1. Pick task from PLANS.md or TODO.md
2. Implement changes
3. Run `bun run check` (lint + type-check)
4. Run tests if affected
5. Commit with semantic message + co-author
6. Push to origin
7. Update this state file

### Commit Pattern
```
<type>: <description>

<optional detailed description>

Co-Authored-By: duyetbot <duyetbot@users.noreply.github.com>
```

### Stop Hooks
- 5+ consecutive test failures
- 3+ consecutive push failures
- Unresolvable type check errors
- Unresolvable lint errors
- User interruption (Ctrl+C)

### Cost Tracking
- Primary model: glm-4.7
- Monitor cost distribution by model
- Optimize for cost-effective model usage

### Active Projects
- [x] Dashboard Iteration 9: Virtual scrolling for messages (COMPLETED)
- [x] Dashboard Iteration 10: Skeleton screens (COMPLETED)
- [x] Dashboard Iteration 11: Test infrastructure setup (COMPLETED)
- [x] Dashboard Iteration 12: Extract utilities + 35 new tests (COMPLETED)
- [ ] Dashboard test coverage: Continue toward 80% target (CURRENT: ~40-50% with 57 tests)
- [ ] Other PLANS.md items as prioritized

### Completed Iterations
**Iteration 12** (Dashboard Test Expansion):
- Extracted event-utils.ts: formatEventTimestamp, formatDuration, getStatusVariant, getStatusLabel (20 tests)
- Extracted dashboard-utils.ts: getGridClass, getTrendDirection, formatCompactNumber (15 tests)
- Updated QuickStats.tsx and EventsContent.tsx to use extracted utilities
- Test count: 22 → 57 (+35 tests)
- Estimated coverage: 30% → 40-50%
- Commit: `ba5b261` test(dashboard): add 35 new tests for extracted utilities

**Iteration 11** (Test Infrastructure):
- Added vitest config with path aliases
- 22 initial tests passing
- Coverage foundation established (~30%)

**Iteration 10** (Skeleton Screens):
- DashboardSkeleton component
- Loading state improvements

**Iteration 9** (Virtual Scrolling):
- GroupedVirtuoso implementation
- Smart switching for large datasets

### Last Update
- **Time**: 2025-12-30 23:07 UTC
- **Action**: Iteration 12 complete - 35 new tests for extracted utilities
- **Next**: Continue dashboard test expansion toward 80% coverage target

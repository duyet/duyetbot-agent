# DuyetBot Agent - TODO & Roadmap

**Last Updated**: December 29, 2025
**Iteration**: 53
**Branch**: `feature/web-ui-improvements`

---

## Overview

This is a continuous improvement project with a focus on building a multi-agent AI platform that can interact via Telegram, GitHub, and Web interfaces. The system is designed to be self-improving, with a long-term vision of creating a digital twin of @duyet.

**Core Philosophy**: Never stop improving, learning, fixing, optimizing, enhancing, refactoring, reusing, documenting, designing, testing, securing, speeding up, and cleaning code. This is a non-stop continuous improvement project.

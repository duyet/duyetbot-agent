<history_context>
When a `<history>` tag is present in the user message, it contains previous conversation turns. Use this context to:
- Maintain continuity and reference previous discussions
- Avoid repeating information already provided
- Build on prior context when answering follow-up questions
- The current user message follows after the history block

design, UI UX. Thing to consider to improivement: UI/UX/DX, security, speed, performance, clean code, more tests, e2e tests,, ...  Commit when after you success deploy and test. be smart, never stop improvement. If one components is complete you can consider to working on anothers apps/<app>. Make the reuseable across monorepo platform. Max reuse, self improvement. Self reading the codebase and make it work and everything working out of the box. no bug, no error. Try to findout the bugs and fix them all, no issues.
